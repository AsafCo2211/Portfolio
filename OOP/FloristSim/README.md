# 🌸 FloristSim – Flower Shop Management Simulator (Java)

A console-based simulation game that models the operations of a flower shop.  
Developed as part of the Object-Oriented Software Design course at  
Ben-Gurion University.

---

## 📌 Project Status
✅ Completed – full implementation of flower shop simulation, customer interactions, and inventory management.

---

## 🎯 Features
- CLI-based simulation of a flower shop
- Manage inventory of flowers and bouquets
- Customer system: buying, requesting bouquets, special orders
- Simulation of daily operations (stock updates, sales, orders)
- Logging of transactions and system outputs
- Flexible design for adding new flower types or shop behaviors

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)  
- Design Patterns: Strategy, Factory, Observer  
- JUnit (unit tests)
